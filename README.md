# Flutter Template

This is new Flutter template project is designed to provide a simple starting point for Flutter applications, with core features already implemented out of the box.

## Features

- **App Controller**: Centralizes the app state with static variables.
- **Route Controller**: Handles navigation and routing within the app.
- **Store Controller**: Manages local storage.
- **Themes**: Supports dark, light, and system themes.
- **Localization**: Handles language changes between Italian and English. For each language supported by the app, there should be a corresponding .arb file. For example, here you already have an app_en.arb and an app_it.arb. Each of these files will contain the same keys, but the values will be the translations of the text into the respective language. 
- **Authentication**: Login and logout functionality is already implemented (ajust the .env file with your domain).
